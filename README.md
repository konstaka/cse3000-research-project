# Evaluating Data Distribution Based Concept Drift Detectors

This repository is the code contribution of my BSc thesis, part of the [Research Project](https://github.com/TU-Delft-CSE/Research-Project) 2022-2023-2 of [TU Delft](https://https//github.com/TU-Delft-CSE).

## Structure

The implemented concept drift detectors can be found in the file `Detectors.ipynb`. The helper scripts used to format the data into LaTeX tables are in the `helper` folder.
